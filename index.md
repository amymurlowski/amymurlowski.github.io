Amy Murlowski, BSN, RN graduates May 2025 with a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, specializing as a Womenâ€™s Health Nurse Practitioner. Amy excels at listening, patient communication and education. Her versatility, determination, and easygoing personality make her a valuable team member. Amy's background in inpatient obestetric nursing and a passion for process improvement mean she will be an asset to any team.

Amy is seeking a position in a clinic providing obsetric and gynecologic care. She enjoys all aspects of women's health - contraceptive education, problem solving with patients, prenatal and postpartum care, life transitions, and more. 

Even in high school, Amy provided peer education on contraception and anatomy. She began nursing school on day one with the intention on gaining women's health experience and moving into a nurse practitioner role. With both inpatient experience in Antepartum care and Labor and Delivery, and outpatient experience in PACU surgical recovery, Amy has a strong background as a registered nurse that has prepared her to transition into the practitioner role.

Passionate about equitable care for patients of size, Amy has spent over a decade dedicated to peer education and process improvements. Her doctoral project, with her partner Diane Johnson, CNM, focused on nurses' percieved ability to support patients coping during labor and birth.
