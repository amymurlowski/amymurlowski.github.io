Amy Murlowski, BSN, RN graduates May 2025 with a Doctorate of Nursing Practice from the University of Nebraska Medical Center, specializing as a Womenâ€™s Health Nurse Practitioner.

Even in high school, Amy provided peer education on contraception and anatomy. She began nursing school focused on gaining women's health experience and moving into a nurse practitioner role. With both inpatient experience in Antepartum care and Labor and Delivery, and outpatient experience in PACU surgical recovery, Amy has a strong background as a registered nurse that has prepared her to transition into the practitioner role.

Passionate about equitable care for patients of size, Amy has spent over a decade dedicated to peer education and process improvements. Her doctoral project, with her partner Diane Johnson, CNM, focused on nurses' percieved ability to support patients coping during labor and birth.

Amy holds both a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Bachelor of Arts in Behavioral Science from the Metropolitan State University of Denver.
