## Doctoral Project Overview

I’m in my second year of my Doctorate of Nursing Practice program, and my doctoral project is well underway!

For this project I am currently seeking Colorado community clinic(s) for needs assessment regarding equipment, supplies, and resources for patients of size. All clinics see patients of size, but frequently clinics fall short of identifying patient needs and staying up to date on best practices. Project planning is ongoing, but will require limited time commitment, and no funding.

## Simple workflow:

## Examples of frequent opportunities for improvement:
- What is the weight limit on the exam tables, beds, scales & equipment you use? Who has access to this information when rooming patients?
- Is there extra wide seating in your waiting areas? Patient rooms?
- How many rooms in your workplace have multiple blood pressure cuff sizes? How do staff identify which cuff to use?
- Do policies include information on what patients need long needles for IM injections?
- Do you have extended gown sizing?
- Where do you refer patients to get imaging if they don’t fit into a standard CT/MRI?
- Where would you recommend a patient purchase an extra large brace? A high-weight walker?
- etc.
